## Is it right for you?

| Your situation | What ReadMD does |
| --- | --- |
| A file exceeds 8,000 lines or 500 KB | Semantic pagination keeps the outline and Ctrl+F search usable |
| A table lacks separators or math is unclosed | Rendering repairs the display in memory while the original stays unchanged |
| You have DOCX / PPTX / XLSX / PDF / HTML | Convert it to Markdown instead of rebuilding formatting by hand |
| An image contains text you need | Use native OS OCR in an offline workflow where supported |
| You write papers or technical documents | Use BibTeX cards, theorem/proof boxes and LaTeX export |
| You want desktop companion & interaction | CC0 Arch-Chan Live2D & 73 micro-breathing sprites with full-stack bubble sync |
| You need lossless PDF text repair | Built-in vector PDF editor with zero-contamination gate and one-click rollback |
| You want an AI-assisted workflow | Use the VS Code extension and FastMCP stdio server (21 tools) |
| Multilingual team collaboration | 46 languages 100% dictionary parity (1563 keys) with zero English copy leaks |

## Start in three steps

1. Download the installer or portable build for your system.
2. Open a real large file and check outline, search and table rendering.
3. Edit only when you are ready; rendering repairs do not silently write to your source.

## Desktop Companion Pet System (Live2D & 73 Breathing Sprites)

- **CC0 Arch-Chan Live2D**: High-definition Live2D skeletal animation that dynamically reacts to reading progress and time of day, featuring smooth drag, mouse pass-through, and high-sensitivity hit testing.
- **73 Petdex Sprites with Micro-Breathing Engine**: Automatic geometry inference resolves dense spritesheets and standalone icons with zero latency; bottom-anchor sinusoidal micro-breathing brings static sprites to life.
- **Companion Life State Engine**: Persistent growth system with Level, Energy, Mood, and Affection, supporting petting, feeding, playing, resting, and waking interactions.
- **Full-Stack Bubble & Context Menu Sync**: Floating desktop window, in-app widget, and settings stage keep dialogue bubbles synchronized in real-time, integrated with the Electron tray menu.
- **Tactile Apple-Style Slider (/apple-design)**: Apple HIG 4px slim track with an 18px physical tactile knob, active energy glow, and tabular numeral pill readouts.

## Native Vector PDF Editor

- **Structural & Microscopic Audit**: Automatically inspects PDF geometry, DPI, rotation, file locks, and samples background color/noise in specified regions.
- **Zero-Contamination Gate**: Simulates edits in a sandbox and generates differential comparison images and heatmaps; strictly prevents writing to the original file unless verified.
- **Safe Persistence & One-Click Rollback**: Automatically creates physical `.bak` backups and unlocks Windows read-only flags; supports instant rollback to the original file.

## Why star ReadMD?

ReadMD solves the unglamorous problems in a long-lived document library: large files remain readable, imported material needs less cleanup, sensitive drafts stay local, and the original file retains final authority. If it saves you one cleanup session, please [star the repository](https://github.com/Natsummerance/rust-ReadMD) so other writers can find it.
